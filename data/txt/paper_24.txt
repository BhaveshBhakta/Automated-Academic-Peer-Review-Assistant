Abstract:
This paper introduces a novel method for optimizing learning rates in machine
learning. A previously unrecognized proportionality between learning rates and
dataset sizes is discovered, providing valuable insights into how dataset scale
influences training dynamics. Additionally, a cumulative learning constant is
identified, offering a framework for designing and optimizing advanced learning
rate schedules. These findings have the potential to enhance training
efficiency and performance across a wide range of machine learning
applications.
