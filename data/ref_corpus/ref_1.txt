Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in clinical predictive analytics, enabling the early detection of diseases and improving patient outcomes. By analyzing electronic health records (EHRs), ML algorithms can identify subtle patterns that are often missed by traditional statistical approaches.  
Supervised learning models, particularly logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, have shown strong performance in predicting outcomes such as hospital readmission and disease progression.  
One of the main challenges lies in handling missing and noisy clinical data, which often requires preprocessing techniques and imputation strategies. Additionally, interpretability of models remains critical in healthcare to ensure trust and regulatory compliance.
